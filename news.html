			<ul class="news-list">
				<li><span>8/24/23</span> We got our Notice of Award today for our R01 on Mechanotransduction via LIM Domain Protein Mechanosensing! 5 more years of funding to keep exploring all the amazing things that LIM domains do!
				<li><span>8/22/23</span> Maggie had a successful first thesis committee meeting. They approved her thesis proposal and she's excited to keep making more progress!
				<li><span>7/12/23</span> Joey absolutely killed it at his qualifying exam. Congrats on passing this milestone Joey!
				<li><span>7/10/23</span> Melissa in the Beach lab successfully defended her PhD thesis. She gave a great seminar and it was a fun defense to participate in. We've gotten to do some <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.26.538303v1">amazing science</a> with Melissa during her time here at Loyola and are looking forward to all her future successes as a postdoc with Matthieu Piel starting in the new year.  Congratulations Melissa!<br>
					<img class="news-image" src="images/Melissa_defense.jpg" height="300"><br>
				<li><span>6/25/23</span> Patrick and Alexia were at the <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://www.grc.org/cell-contact-and-adhesion-conference/2023/">Cell Contact & Adhesion Gordon Research Conference</a>. Alexia presented a poster on her T cell migration work and got lots of good feedback. It was great connecting with friends old and new!
				<li><span>6/20/23</span> Shreya's review paper on using optogenetics to alter cell mechanics was accepted today! This is a good primer on the iLID RhoA system we use in the lab and how it can affect cytoskeletal flows and force production. Check it out <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2023.106442">here</a>! And be on the lookout for her future work using this system and looking at septins!
				<li><span>6/20/23</span> Asia defended her Masters thesis today. She did a great job showing off all her cool data on leader blebb migration. Congratulations Asia!<br>
					<img class="news-image" src="images/Asia_defense.jpg" height="300"><br>
				<li><span>6/9/23</span> Our really exciting collaboration with <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="http://www.shinlabuva.com/">Jung-Bum Shin at UVA</a> is out today in <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72681">eLife</a>! They began by studying actin repair in stereocilia after hearing damage. Their initial study found a short isoform of the protein XIRP2 localized to breaks the actin filaments and hypothesized that XIRP2 was mechanosensitive because it contained a single LIM domain. During their revision they reached out to us to verify that XIRP2 was mechanosensitive. It turns out they were partly right. XIRP2 is mechanosensitive, but it's not via the LIM domain. Instead it's the unstructured C-terminus domain! We're super excited to continue this collaboration and learn all we can about this novel mechanosensing domain. 
				<li><span>6/8/23</span> Patrick led a workshop on quantitative image analysis at the <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://planitpurple.northwestern.edu/event/590383">Northwestern Quantitative  Biology Symposium</a>, hosted by the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology
				<li><span>6/8/23</span> Our collaboration with Wen-hung from the Gardel lab on how myosin monomers aggregate under different conditions to promote filament formation is out on <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.07.544121v1">bioR&chi;iv</a>! This work explores how myosin grows on stress fibers and the underlying mechanisms. Check it out!
				<li><span>6/1/23</span> Our collaboration with <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://www.augusta.edu/mcg/dnrm/faculty/vitriollab.php">Eric Vitriol</a> and the Beach Lab on the processivity of non-muscle myosin II is out in <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2023.05.014">Biophysical Journal</a> today! Go check out the final version! The movies are especially fun!
				<li><span>5/8/23</span> Stefano and Patrick wrote a <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.03.030">Quick Guide on LIM domain proteins</a> for Current Biology. Check it out for a brief intro to why we find these proteins so fascinating!
				<li><span>4/27/23</span> Melissa's paper about non-muscle myosin 2 assembly has been posted to <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.26.538303v1">bioR&chi;iv</a>! This is a tour de force of quantitative imaging. She shows that actin dynamics play a critical role in modulating myosin monomer levels that allow for filament formation. She also uses beautiful molecular counting to determine that the diffraction limited filaments we see on the microscope actually already contain multiple nm2 filaments! This highlights how important myosin-myosin interactions are in establishing new filaments. Check out all the details in the <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.26.538303v1">preprint</a>! Twitter thread is below:<br>

This was part of our P01 work funded by the NIAID. Congrats to Minsoo Kim's lab at the University of Rochester Medical Center on this massive work! 
				<li><span>4/14/23</span> Patrick had a great time visiting the University of Toledo and giving a talk. It was my first department visit since the pandemic began and it was awesome to talk with so many people face to face again!

				<li><span>3/1/23</span> Jordan and Patrick were interviewed by M&aacute;t&eacute; P&aacute;lfy at the Journal of Science for their <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.260939">Cell scientists to watch</a> series! They talked about what it's like to run a joint lab and how they try to balance young children and science. 
				<li><span>3/1/23</span> We just posted our paper on using <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00176">machine learning to predict traction streses in adherent cells</a>! We're very excited to get this out to the world. This started as a pandemic project when we were all house bound. We wondered if we could use machine learning to make predictions about traction stresses. It succeeded beyond our wildest dreams and actually became a story about how we can use different machine learning approaches to discover new models of living systems. Check out the twitter thread here:<br>

				<li><span>2/26/23</span> Our latest collaboration with Eric Vitriol and Jordan Beach is out <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.24.529920v1">investigating processivitiy of non-muscle myosin 2 inside cells</a>! This was a totally fun and unexpected direction when we saw myosin 2 peforming all sorts of anterograde processive motion in CAD cells. It is likely a product of their distinct actin architecture, but we think it probably happens in a variety of other systems. Will be interesting to explore this topic further!
				<li><span>1/8/23-1/13/23</span> Alexia will be giving a talk at the <a class="unadorned" target="blank" href="https://www.grc.org/directed-cell-migration-conference/2023/">Directed Cell Migration Gordon Research Conference</a>! She will also be attending the GRS.
