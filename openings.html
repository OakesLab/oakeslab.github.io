			<em>Updated November 30th, 2023</em><p>
			In collaboration with the <a class="unadorned" href="https://squishycell.uchicago.edu/">Gardel Lab</a> and <a class="unadorned" href="https://home.uchicago.edu/~vitelli/">Vitelli Lab</a> at the University of Chicago we are using machine learning to develop new models of living systems. Our <a class="unadorned" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00176">initial work</a> in this area is focused on building novel models of cellular contractility, but there is ample room for this work to grow in multiple directions! We're looking for potential postdocs that could work jointly between the three labs, depending on interest and skill sets. Interested parties should reach out directly to <a class="unadorned" href="https://patrickoakeslab.com/contact.html">Patrick</a> and <a class="unadorned" href="https://squishycell.uchicago.edu/team/#pi">Margaret</a> to discuss details.

			<!-- <h3 class="linkheader">Specialized Imaging Fellow</h3>
			<em>Updated October 20th, 2022</em><p>
			The Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology (CaMP) at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine is recruiting a post-doctoral level Specialized Imaging Fellow who will serve as the Assistant Director of the CaMP Specialized Imaging Resource Center. The ideal candidate will have 3+ years of experience in acquisition and quantitative analysis of high resolution microscopy data using advanced imaging systems. The Fellow will help maintain existing microscopes, consult users on experimental design, train new users in image acquisition, train users in quantitative image analysis, collect and analyze publication quality data for labs without long-term imaging needs, and assist with microscopy equipment grants. During this 2-year appointment, the Fellow will interact with scientists in a department with diverse imaging experience, biological questions, and specimen scale, placing the Fellow in an ideal position to obtain a future position in microscopy core management or transitioning to industry positions in microscopy. Additional career development endeavors will be encouraged, such as attending advanced microscopy training courses and/or developing in-house lectures and workshops. Department-level responsibilities will be supplemented with project(s) in cytoskeletal dynamics in cardiac and non-muscle systems with <a class="unadorned" href="https://sites.google.com/view/jordanbeachlab/home">Drs. Jordan Beach</a>, <a class="unadorned" href="https://kirklab.com/">Jonathan Kirk</a>, and <a class="unadorned" href="https://patrickoakeslab.com/">Patrick Oakes</a>, enabling the Fellow to more intensely engage in curiosity-driven science.
			<p>
			Department imaging infrastructure consists of the following:
			<ul>
				<li>A Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan Confocal
				<li>A Yokogawa W1 Spinning Disc Confocal with Phasor Spatial Illumination and ring TIRF from 3i
				<li>A Yokogawa W1 Spinning Disc Confocal SoRA Super Resolution microscope with dual cameras
				<li>A Cytiva INCell Analyzer 2500HS high content imager
				<li>A Mizar Tilt Lightsheet microscope
			</ul>

			In addition to standard imaging approaches, the Fellow will gain experience in advanced imaging techniques, including Traction Force Microscopy, iLID-based optogenetics, laser ablation/microsurgery, and single-molecule tracking.
			<p>
			Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine is located in Maywood, IL, on the outskirts of Chicago (11 miles to downtown) and provides diverse residential opportunities (urban to rural) with easy access to the <a class="unadorned" href="https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-cities-us">Best Big City in the U.S. for six straight years</a>.
